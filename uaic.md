### Global From Day One Venture Capital Competition
I created a Venture Capital competition in partnership with Global From Day One, a technology-based venture capital fund who invest in
New Zealand hardware, software and deep technology startups. The competition had competitors follow their own investment thesis to invest $15m portfolio in three New Zealand startups. Their portfolio allocation was supported by qualitative analysis.

## Women Engagement Initiative

I started the University of Auckland's Women Engagement Initiative to break down barriers discouraging women from considering careers in finance. UAIC created a Mentoring Programme pairing 15 industry mentors with 15 mentees. We facilitated a three-part speaker series focusing on careers in finance, the future of finance with an emphasis on Financial technology and challenges in the workplace.
