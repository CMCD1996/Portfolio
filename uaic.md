In 2020, I led the University of Auckland Investment Club (UAIC) as Co President with David Saul. In addition to running several of UAIC's legacy offerings, We introduced several new initiatives.

## **Bulletin**
David oversaw the Bulletin, a weekly publication of finance-related articles written by students. Articles address finance, investing and market-related events or theories. During our term, the Bulletin team published twelve editions of the bulletin.

During my term, brokerage was approved enabling the fund to start investing. Subsequently, the fund made four investments in NZX and ASX equities in 2020.

New Zealand hardware, software and deep technology startups. The competition had competitors follow their investment thesis to allocate $15m in three New Zealand startups. Their portfolio allocation was supported by qualitative analysis. Click the image below to view the competition pack.

### **UBS New Zealand Investment Banking Competition**
I created an Investment Banking competition in partnership with UBS New Zealand. The competition has competing teams assess two transactions which are large, influential and involve strategics. Teams assess the strategic rationale, offer context, synergies and performance of both transactions. Their analysis is presented to a panel of judges with competitors asked finance-related questions.  Click the image below for competition pack.

## **Women Engagement Initiative**

I started the University of Auckland's Women Engagement Initiative to break down barriers discouraging women from considering careers in finance. This initiative includes a Mentoring Programme where 15 industry mentors were paired with 15 mentees. We facilitated a three-part speaker series focusing on careers in finance, the future of finance with an emphasis on financial technology and challenges in the workplace.
