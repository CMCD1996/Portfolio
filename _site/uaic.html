        <p>In 2020, I led the University of Auckland Investment Club (UAIC) as Co President with David Saul. In addition to running several of UAIC’s legacy offerings, We introduced several new initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="bulletin"><strong>Bulletin</strong></h2>
<p>David oversaw the Bulletin, a weekly publication of finance-related articles written by students. Articles address finance, investing and market-related events or theories. During our term, the Bulletin team published twelve editions of the bulletin.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bulletin.jpeg" alt=" Bulletin" /></p>

<h2 id="investment-committee"><strong>Investment Committee</strong></h2>
<p>I oversaw the operation of the Investment Committee, a group of analysts who manage the Club’s Investment Fund. The committee perform due diligence on investment opportunities. During my term, brokerage was approved enabling the fund to start investing. Subsequently, the fund made four investments in NZX and ASX equities in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="education"><strong>Education</strong></h2>
<p>David led UAIC’s education portfolio which host a series of finance-related events to educate members on the different areas in finance. These events include careers panels, investing tutorials, introductions to ethical investing and an investor’s role in social innovation.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/education.jpeg" alt=" Education " /></p>

<h2 id="competitions"><strong>Competitions</strong></h2>
<p>I ran four finance-related competitions in 2020: The Citi Global Markets Challenge, Jarden Stock Pitch Competition, Global From Day One Venture Capital Competition and UBS New Zealand Investment Banking Competition. Citi run the Global Markets Challenge annually.  I introduced the other three competitions this year.</p>

<h3 id="jarden-stock-pitch-competition"><strong>Jarden Stock Pitch Competition</strong></h3>
<p>I upgraded UAIC’s annual Stock Pitch competition in partnership with Jarden. Competing teams prepared qualitative and
quantitative analysis on an NZX/ASX listed equity to support a buy recommendation. Click the image below to view the competition pack.</p>

<h3 id="global-from-day-one-venture-capital-competition"><strong>Global From Day One Venture Capital Competition</strong></h3>
<p>I created a Venture Capital competition in partnership with Global From Day One, a technology-based venture capital fund who invest in
New Zealand hardware, software and deep technology startups. The competition had competitors follow their investment thesis to allocate $15m in three New Zealand startups. Their portfolio allocation was supported by qualitative analysis. Click the image below to view the competition pack.</p>

<h3 id="ubs-new-zealand-investment-banking-competition"><strong>UBS New Zealand Investment Banking Competition</strong></h3>
<p>I created an Investment Banking competition in partnership with UBS New Zealand. The competition has competing teams assess two transactions which are large, influential and involve strategics. Teams assess the strategic rationale, offer context, synergies and performance of both transactions. Their analysis is presented to a panel of judges with competitors asked finance-related questions.  Click the image below for competition pack.</p>

<h2 id="women-engagement-initiative"><strong>Women Engagement Initiative</strong></h2>

<p>I started the University of Auckland’s Women Engagement Initiative to break down barriers discouraging women from considering careers in finance. This initiative includes a Mentoring Programme where 15 industry mentors were paired with 15 mentees. We facilitated a three-part speaker series focusing on careers in finance, the future of finance with an emphasis on financial technology and challenges in the workplace.
