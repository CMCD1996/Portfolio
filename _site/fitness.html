<p>I followed the subsequent training schedule over the 2018/2019 summer when training for my first Ironman.
Approximate training time per week was 20 hours for 12 weeks (240 hours).
Training preceding this schedule was skills based, approximately 8 hours per week for 45 weeks (360 hours).
Total training time was approximately 600 hours.</p>

<h3 id="tauranga-half-2019"><strong>Tauranga Half 2019</strong></h3>

<p>I competed in the Tauranga Half Multi Sport event in January 2019. This was my first triathlon race. The race includes a 1.9k swim, 90km cycle and 21.1km run. The swim was my first open water swim. I had issues with sighting but persevered. The cycle was three circuits from Mt Maunganui down the straight towards Papamoa and back. The run included a couple laps around the base of Mt Maunganui in approximately 30 degrees celsius. I finished in just under 6 hours with many lessons learned for the next race.</p>

<h3 id="ironman-new-zealand-2019"><strong>Ironman New Zealand 2019</strong></h3>

<p>I completed my first full distance Ironman in March 2019. The race is comprised of a 3.9km swim, a 180km cycle and 42.2km run. I had my best swim yet recording approximately 1 hour 11 mins. The bike was brutal as you race 45km from the Taupo centre to Reporoa and back. You complete this circuit twice which includes tackling heartbreak hill multiple times. Unfavourable wind direction changes led to a headwind for 135km of the ride. The bike was slow and featured multiple punctures. I finished the cycle just after disembarking just over 7 hours earlier. I was ready to run after the transition. However, my first few strides were accompanied with sharp ankle pains which jolted up my leg. Unfortunately, I injured myself on the bike with an incorrect bike setup rendering myself incapable of running without excruciating pain. I reached a crossroads in my Ironman journey. I had come too far, trained for approximately 600 hours and had a whole community backing me. I could muster a painful walk so preceded to walk 42km to finish the race against all odds. Approximately 15 hours and 45 minutes later, I had finished my first Ironman. I am most grateful for William and Angela Cook who cheered me on from the beginning of the race, and my parents Steve and Janet McDowall who surprised me mid race to cheer me to the finish line. I can not wait to do another full distance race offshore when the boarders open up.</p>

<h3 id="ironman-703-sunshine-coast-2019"><strong>Ironman 70.3 Sunshine Coast 2019</strong></h3>

<p>In September 2019, I flew to the Sunshine to visit my childhood friend Trevor and his family (Di and Dave pictured below). While I was there, I competed in the Ironman 70.3 Sunshine Coast. My university schedule and other priorities led to a more relaxed training schedule. It was lovely soaking in the sights on the sunshine coast as I pushed through the 1.9km swim, 90km cycle and 21.1km run. It was tough in approximately 30 degrees celsius again. I finished the race approximately 6 hours 20 minutes. It was a great trip visiting an old friend from childhood.</p>

<h3 id="ironman-703-new-zealand-2022"><strong>Ironman 70.3 New Zealand 2022</strong></h3>
<p>In December 2022, I travelled to Taupō, New Zealand to compete. The COVID pandemic &amp; Unversity put triathlon on hold over 2020 &amp; 2021. The event was originally scheduled for March 2022, but New Zealand’s COVID red zones cancelled the event, having to transfer race entry to either December 2022 or January 2023.</p>

<p>This was an incredible challenging race with no shortage of obstacles. A number of viruses swept through Auckland in the weeks leading up to the race. I fell ill with a non-COVID related flu the week before, present on race day, leading to breathing issues from chest soreness &amp; congestion. Additionally, the flu caused a lack of sleep leading up to the race. I was adapting to a new diet to manage a newly discovered allergy. Therefore, energy levels were quite low. Some old injuries flared up, mainly pain in the knees. Last minute transport cancellations led to a contigency plan of 12-hour train ride with bike in hand to Wellington on Thursday, followed by a 5-hour car ride on Friday to get to race day on saturday, and a 6-hour bus ride back to Auckland on Sunday. Rental car prices were spiking, and Intercity buses between Auckland to Taupō were not taking bikes.</p>

<p>I made it to race day. It was the first wet race in my dabbling with triathlon. The lake was flat like a bath, perfect for the swim. The ride out and back from Reporoa was wet, contending with rain &amp; moderate headwinds. The run saw all conditions. There was torrential rain at one stage, and clear skis with sunshine at another. I managed to get sunburned of all things. After I finished, with the Ironman athletes on the course, lightning strikes illuminated the ski met with booming thunder echoing across the central plateau.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I finished with an extremely slow time just under 8-hours. Approximately, 40 minute swim, 3-hour 40 minute cycle, &amp; 3-hour 10 minute run (jog/walk). After all the obstacles, there was no way I wasn’t going to cross the finish line for my last triathlon for the time being. I switch my attention to some more recreational interests as the ski slopes &amp; fairways call my name.</p>
