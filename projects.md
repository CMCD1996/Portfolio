## Design and build a prototype wind turbine (2018)

I lead a four person team tasked to designed, built, and tested a wind turbine to operate at 140 rpm. Blade profile design was simulated using MATLAB and Xfoil to optimise profile aerodynamics. Optimal profiles were modelled in Dassault Systemes Solidworks and laser cut from sheets of Perspex. 

Blade profile aerodynamics were optimised through the maximisation of the power coefficient $$C_p = \frac{P_E}{P_T}$$
