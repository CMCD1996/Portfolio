title: "Book Review XVIII: Psychopolitics... by Byungchul Han"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The series documents a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview
Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power features in the Verso Series, a series of essay-length philosophical and political interventions addressing the outer limits of political and social possibilities. This entry focuses on Neoliberalism, representing a highly efficient and intelligent system for exploiting freedom to maximise returns. A subset of ideas expressed in these essays include: crises facing freedom; the commands of power, expressions on freedom, and the strengths of smart power; Foucault's discussion on biopolitics, the governmental technology of disciplinary power, and the dilemmas facing his analysis; emotional capitalism; the enlistment  of gamification in emotional capitalism to improve productivity; the rise of dataism and the exacerbation of the 'quantified self'; and comparisons between our increasing surveilled society and the totalitarian society in George Orwell's 1984.

### Lessons
* Philosophical and political theories, perspectives and applications provide useful commentary to better understand the technological, anthropological, and social developments. It is important to draw on the wider body of academic literature surrounding these aspects when problem solving and thinking critically. 
* Further re-enforces the both positive and negative impacts in a data-driven world.


### Reflections
* It is important to take caution when mass-adopting new technologies surrounding data. We do not yet understand the longitudinal impacts from mass-adoption. However, this sentiment most likely accompanied previous adoptions of new technologies. Philosophical and political musings help leaders in making decisions that may shape both their communities and wider society.
