title: "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series.
The series documents a brief overview of each book,
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview

Gatsby ensnares the imaginations of Nick and Daisy,
drawing them into a world of a glamour and excess.
Gatsby pursues Daisy, consumed by his desire to be with her.
Unfortunately, his world proves to be a farce.
Daisy chooses to remain with Tom in his world of wealth.
Gatsby's world unravels, gunned down by a grieving spouse whose wife was
collateral in the fallout from Daisy, Tom and Gatsby's love triangle.
Additionally, F. Scott Fitzgerald is a sensational writer with an eloquent and lyrical writing style.

### Lessons

- Do not judge people on face value.
- Wealth enables opportunity but does not solve all problems or lead to happiness.
- Do not forget your roots.
- Do not lose your sense of self over a romantic interest who is not committed or transparent in their feelings towards you.

### Reflections

- The main reflection is things are not always what they appear, necessitating caution.
- Secondly, F. Scott Fitzgerald captures the sentiment surrounding the 1920s.
  Today, wealth inequality runs rampant with access and opportunity separating the rich and the poor.
  Lessons from The Great Gatsby highlight what wealth brings, the impact on relationships, and the realities surrounding wealth.
  You may be the wealthiest person in the world but simultaneously lack meaningful relationships which make life whole.
- Lastly, take notice of red flags when starting personal, professional and romantic relationships.
  You may save yourself a lot of pain by acknowledging and addressing them early.
