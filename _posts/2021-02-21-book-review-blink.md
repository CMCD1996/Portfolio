title: "Book Review X: Blink - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell "
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The series documents a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview

Malcolm Gladwell outlines the powers of our brain's ability to make snap judgments.
He explores the positives and negatives of these abilities through case studies.
I itemize a subset of these cases:
* Divorce prediction 
* Military training exercises 
* Art acquisitions
* Presidential elections

### Lessons
* Thin-Slicing is a powerful and dangerous subconscious behavior.
* There is structure to spontaneity and creative processes. 
* Excess communication can inhibit productivity.

### Reflections
* It is important to recognize and mitigate subconscious biases as necessary when making decisions.
Failing to consider subconscious biases may perpetuate inequality, financial losses, and poor quality relationships in personal, professional, and social contexts.
