title: "Book Review X: Blink - The Power of Thinking with Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell "
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The intent of the series is to document a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learnt and a reflection how these lessons apply to
personal, professional and societal contexts.

### Overview

Malcolm Gladwell outlines the powers of our brain's ability to make snap judgements.
He explores the positives and negatives of these abilities through case studies.
A subset of these cases are subsequently itemized:
* Divorce prediction 
* Military training exercises 
* Art acquisitions
* Presidential elections

### Lessons
* Thin-Slicing is a powerful and dangerous subconscious behavior.
* There is structure to spontaneity and creative processes. 
* Over communication can be counter productive.

### Reflections
To be continued...
