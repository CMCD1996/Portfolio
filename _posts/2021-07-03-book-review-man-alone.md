title: "Man Alone by John Mulgan"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series.
The series documents a brief overview of each book,
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview

Man Alone follows the story of Johnson, an Englishman immigrating to New Zealand after the Great War.
Johnson begins in Auckland, traversing down and across the central plateau, returning to Auckland when circumstances force him to leave the country. He led a solitary life moving from one work opportunity to another without any stability.
The narrative conveys depression-era struggles, relationships with nature, and New Zealand's stereotypical masculine identity.

### Lessons

- Repeating commentary implies the importance of owning equity or 'land'.
- A solitary life is not very satisfactory.
- Masculine stereotype in New Zealand.
- Rapid economic development shapes culture and community.

### Reflections

The commentary on land ownership informs New Zealand's relationship with property.
As at July 15th 2021, the country continues to experience a 'housing crisis'.
Several factors contribute to this issue including our expectations of a 'backyard with a bach' being the epitome of the kiwi lifestyle. It will be interesting to see aforementioned issues progress.
Commentary on land ownership reflects this sentiment.
