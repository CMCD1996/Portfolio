title: "Book Review IV: Principles by Ray Dalio"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The series documents a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview
Ray Dalio teaches the lessons he learned throughout building Bridgewater Associates and his personal life through a series of 'Principles'.
The book is split into three parts addressing an auto-bibliography, life principles, and work principles.

### Lessons
* Meaningful relationships are foremost in living meaningful lives.
* It is important to be courageous and not fear failure to innovate at the highest level.
* The preservation of your culture is paramount when building and maintaining an exceptional organisation.
* One of my favourite principles is 'embrace reality and deal with it'

### Reflections
* The insight on meaningful relationships informs how to live great lives. Many fall into bad circumstances out of their control.
A great relationship with support can make a world of difference in helping those struggling back on their feet. Additionally, these relationships put life into perspective. Learning to fail well while embracing reality may help foster pragmatic and resilient leaders who tackle many of life's hardships to improve their communities.
