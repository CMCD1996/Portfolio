This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The series documents a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview
Ray Dalio teaches the lessons he learned throughout building Bridgewater Associates and his personal life through a series of 'Principles'.
The book is split into three parts addressing an auto-bibliography, life principles, and work principles.

### Lessons
* Meaningful relationships are foremost in living meaningful lives.
* It is important to be courageous and not fear failure to innovate at the highest level.
* The preservation of your culture is utmost important in building and maintaining an exceptional organisation.

### Reflections
