title: "Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series.
The series documents a brief overview of each book,
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview

Invisible Women exposes the data bias towards men perpetuated in most applications and fields within our world.
Caroline addresses bias in daily life, the workplace, design, and public life. Examples include urban infrastructure; the inclusion of urinals in gender-neutral bathrooms, meritocratic myths in the workplace, unisex products, misdiagnoses in the form of Yentl syndrome, refugee camp design, and policy decisions.

### Lessons

- It is both confronting and appalling how the needs of so many people are unmet and not considered.
- Many of these issues are left unheard unless someone with considerable power raises them. This was the case with Sheryl Sandberg when she realized the needs of pregnant employees were unmet at Facebook when she faced challenges using Facebook's facilities when pregnant.
- It is important to provide a platform for all members of society to feel comfortable and enabled to voice their opinions.

### Reflections

- It is imperative to have a diverse range of voices in the room when making any decision related to governance, investment, policy, and design. Stakeholders must be considered from all dimensions while remaining feasible. These insights necessitate governance and leadership reform to promptly close the global gender gap.
