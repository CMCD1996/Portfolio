---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series. 
The series documents a brief overview of each book, 
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview
An American classic outlining life in the deep south during the 1930s
from the perspective of Jeremy and Jean Finch as their father Atticus
defends a black man accused of raping a white girl. The novel covers
themes related to race, class, prejudice, and justice. 

### Lessons
* Children provide unique, valuable, and intelligent insights when given the right opportunities
* It is important to fight for what you believe in, regardless of the odds stacked against you
* Upholding your values can have a profound impact on your community

### Reflections
* Issues often arise from poor communication, misunderstandings, and prejudices. It is disheartening the same issues persist across different contexts.
* It is important to raise critical and courageous thinkers who challenge existing systems. The perspectives from these individuals will help shape new actions to address systemic issues.
