title: "Recommendations - Oh, The Places You'll Go!"
---

One of my favourite childhood books is Oh, the Places You'll Go! by Doctor Seuss.
The book articulates life as a journey full of many twists, turns, successes, failures and adversities.
Some of our best experiences in life come from exploring recommendations made by others.
This entry documents recommendations made by personal and professional connections.
