title: "Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov (Disclaimer: Mature Themes)"
---

This entry is a continuation of my book review series.
The series documents a brief overview of each book,
3-5 lessons learned and a reflection on how these lessons apply to
personal, professional, and societal contexts.

### Overview

Two parts divide the book.
Part I establishes Humbert Humbert (HH), his infliction, motivations and the circumstances leading to meet Dolores Haze whom he describes as his 'Lolita'. HH is a middle-aged man who is sexually attracted to young girls to whom he describes as nymphets.
He moves to America after an unsuccessful marriage where he meets Mrs Haze.
HH is immediately infatuated and aroused by her daughter,
HH and Mrs Haze soon wed with her passing following soon after.
Subsequently, he acts on his sexual fantasies, violating Dolores in a motel room while she is unofficially in his sole custody.
Part II focuses on the fallout from his crimes.
HH continues to groom and condition Dolores into believing she is equally responsible with rouble falling upon her if she disclosures their relationship. The dynamic of their relationship changes as Dolores gradually becomes more disturbed from said relationship. HH desperately tries to control her during her schooling and the cross county road trips they share. On one road trip, Dolores, now fifteen years old, orchestrates her escape from HH with a man she meets. HH is devastated at the loss of his 'Lolita'. Some time later, HH receives a letter from Dolores, now eighteen years old, asking for financial aid to support herself, husband, and newborn on the way. HH tracks Dolores down, learns she initially escaped with a man who makes a living in the adult entertainment industry, and implores her to return with him which she refuses. She left the man she escaped with, meeting her husband whom she relies on for survival. Subsequently, HH tracks down the man she escaped with three years earlier, murders him, and gives himself up to the authorities to be executed by capital punishment.
This book was controversial upon publication in the 1950s (obviously) but is written in a lyrical manner from the perspective of HH, contributing to the novel's establishment as classic literature.

### Lessons

- Those who abuse their power, and neglect their responsibilities as stewards or guardians, can irrevocably corrupt and damage our most vulnerable.
- Children are incredibly vulnerable and must have the right protection and support from civil and social justice systems.
- Those who seem innocent can turn out to be the most sinister. This was the sentiment surrounding notable serial killer e.g. Ted Bundy.

### Reflections

- Heartbreakingly, many children are born or tipped into dangerous circumstances, abused by adults who seek to selfishly benefit from their exploitation. Sexual abuse, slavery and child poverty continue to exist in the 21st century. Every child deserves the right to pursue the opportunities and make the choices which may lead to a good life. Lolita and the accompanying lessons highlights how easy it is for many children to slip through the cracks and importance to continually re-assess and reform our justice systems to protect our most vulnerable.
