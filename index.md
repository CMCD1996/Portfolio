**A Brief Introduction to Engineering Science**

I completed a Bachelor of Commerce / Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree at the University of Auckland (2015 - 2020), majoring in Finance and specialising in Engineering Science.

Engineering scientists use mathematical models and advanced computing to simulate real-world processes, systems and solutions in order to solve the complex problems posed by industry and society. The specialisation builds skills in data science, artificial intelligence, linear and non-linear programming, optimisation, computer science, continuum mechanics, statistics and mathematics. I am equipped to solve problems related to technology, energy, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, transport, mining and infrastructure.

Engineering Science is taught at a few other schools around the world under different names:
* [Stanford: Management Science and Engineering ](https://msande.stanford.edu/)                        
* [Oxford: Engineering Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science)
* [Princeton: Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/)
