**Welcome!**

My name is Connor McDowall. I am a proud kiwi from Aotearoa New Zealand.
This is my personal website detailing on my academic, extra-curricular and professional projects.
I am an Ironman, finance enthusiast and proud mentor.
I strive to solve the most pressing issues in society through intersection of strategy, finance and technology.
In particular, I am interested in addressing the energy transition, the adoption of new technologies, deficiencies in infrastructure, financial illiteracy and gender inequality. I welcome new connections and feel free to contact me directly!
