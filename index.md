**Under Construction**

Hello and welcome to my website.

I completed a Bachelor of Commerce / Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree at the University of Auckland (2015 - 2020), majoring in Finance and specialising in Engineering Science.

Engineering scientists use mathematical models and advanced computing to simulate real-world processes, systems and solutions in order to solve the complex problems posed by industry and society. The specialisation builds skills in data science, artificial intelligence, linear and non-linear programming, optimisation, computer science, continuum mechanics, statistics and mathematics. I am equipped to solve problems related to technology, energy, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, transport, mining and infrastructure.

My interests lie at the intersection of business, finance, and technology.

Technology will continue to play a pivotal role in addressing the most pressing issues facing society. I am interested in utilising technology, venture capital and private equity to address these issues. In particular, I focus on using my skills to address the energy transition, infrastructure needs, financial illiteracy and gender inequality. 

I welcome new connections and do not hesitate to contact me directly.
