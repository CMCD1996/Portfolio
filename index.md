**Welcome!**

{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId %}

My interests lie at the intersection of business, finance, and technology.

I am interested in using technology and finance to address the most pressing issues facing society. In particular, I most interested addressing the energy transition, the adoption of new technologies, deficiencies in infrastructure, financial illiteracy and gender inequality. 

I completed a Bachelor of Commerce / Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree at the University of Auckland (2015 - 2020), majoring in Finance and specialising in Engineering Science.

Engineering scientists use mathematical models and advanced computing to simulate real-world processes, systems and solutions in order to solve the complex problems posed by industry and society. The specialisation builds skills in data science, artificial intelligence, linear and non-linear programming, optimisation, computer science, continuum mechanics, statistics and mathematics. I am equipped to solve problems related to technology, energy, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, transport, mining and infrastructure.

I welcome new connections and do not hesitate to contact me directly.
