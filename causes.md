## **University of Auckland Investment Club in 2020** ##

In 2020, I led the University of Auckland Investment Club (UAIC) as Co President with [David Saul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrjsaul/). We introduced several new initiatives while running several of UAIC's legacy offerings. I lead Competition, Investment Committee, Women Engagement Initiative, Treasurer portfolios while managing sponsorship negotiations and external relationships. David managed Bulletin, Marketing, Education and Social portfolios while managing the implementation of organisational changes.

### **Global From Day One Venture Capital Competition** ###
I created a Venture Capital competition in partnership with Global From Day One, a technology-based venture capital fund who invest in New Zealand hardware, software and deep technology startups. The competition had competitors follow their investment thesis to allocate $15m across three New Zealand startups. Their portfolio allocation was supported by qualitative analysis. **Click the image below to view the competition pack**.

### **UBS New Zealand Investment Banking Competition** ###
I created an Investment Banking competition in partnership with UBS New Zealand. The competition has competing teams assess two transactions which are large, influential and involve strategics. Teams assess the strategic rationale, offer context, synergies and performance of both transactions. Their analysis is presented to a panel of judges with competitors asked finance-related questions. **Click the image below for competition pack**.

### **Women Engagement Initiative** ###

I started the University of Auckland's Women Engagement Initiative to break down barriers discouraging women from considering careers in finance. This initiative includes a Mentoring Programme where 15 industry mentors were paired with 15 mentees. We facilitated a two-part speaker series focusing on careers in finance, challenges in the workplace and the future of finance with an emphasis on financial technology. **Click the image below to view the engagement pack**.

## **Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand Fundraising** ##

I raised $1600 for the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand when training and competing in Ironman New Zealand 2019. The Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand is a charity working towards a society free from discrimination, where all people enjoy positive health and well-being. The foundations primarily educates communities and advocates for policies and services to support those struggling with mental illness.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) conducted analysis on the impact mental, neurological and substance use disorders (MNS) have on the community at large. It is estimated at least 10% of the world's population is affected by MNS disorders and 20% of adolescents and children suffer from some type of mental disorder. The impact of MNS disorders on social and economic well-being is large. The global economy loses approximately $1 trillion annually in productivity due to depression and anxiety. MNS disorders are estimated to contribute to $2.5 - $8.5 trillion globally in economic losses, forecast to double by 2030 [(WHO,2020)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/mental-health).

As a community, it is our responsibility to support our most vulnerable and help the next generation overcome these challenges. **Click the image below to review the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand's website**.
