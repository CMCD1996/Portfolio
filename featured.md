This page features my principles, the advice I pass onto those I mentor and the projects I am actively working on.

I use this set of principles to evaluate opportunities, build relationships and shape the direction of my personal, professional and co-curricular commitments. I was inspired to adopt this framework after reading Principles by Ray Dalio. **Click the image below to review my principles**
